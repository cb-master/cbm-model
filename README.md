# Cloud Bill Master Database Model
Cloud Bill Master Database Model is a PHP-based project that implements a robust, object-oriented database management system for handling complex transactions and data manipulation tasks. Built on top of MySQL, this model aims to provide a high-performance, flexible, and secure way to interact with databases in PHP applications, specifically designed to streamline billing and cloud data management systems.

# Key Features
Object-Oriented Structure: Built with PHP OOP principles, ensuring code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
Custom Database and Model Classes: Uses a custom Database class for managing database connections, queries, and transactions, and a Model class to represent data entities in the application.
Secure Transactions: Implements ACID-compliant transactions for consistent and reliable data handling.
Dynamic Query Builder: Supports dynamic query generation with a range of options for filters, sorting, and pagination, making it easy to create complex queries without directly writing SQL.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and logging for tracking and debugging issues efficiently.
Scalable Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind, suitable for small applications as well as large-scale cloud-based billing systems.
Easy Integration: Integrates seamlessly with other PHP-based applications and frameworks, allowing flexible deployment in diverse environments.
Technologies Used
PHP (Object-Oriented): Core programming language, providing OOP features for structure and maintainability.
MySQL: Relational database management system used for data storage, with optimized queries for faster performance.
PDO (PHP Data Objects): Utilized for secure database access with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
## Installation
Install with composer:
```bash
composer require cb-master/cb-model
```
Configure your database settings in ypur application PHP page top section.
```php
// Require Config File Where Database Variables or CONSTANTS are Provided
require_once("./config.php");

// Require Autoload File
require_once("./vendor/autoload.php");

use CBM\Model\Model;
// Config DB Model
Model::config([
    'host'      =>  'localhost',
    'name'      =>  'database_name',
    'user'      =>  'database_user_here',
    'password'  =>  'database_password_here',
]);

```
